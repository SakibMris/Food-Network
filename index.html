                    What a great meal this turned out to be! Making pork tenderloin is always such an
                    easy dinner fix and
                    always juicy and tender. However, until I started using a wireless meat thermometer.

                <p>
                    I love a good fish sandwich and it has been a while since I’ve had one. I came
                    across this recipe
                    using
                    tilapia, a firm, forgiving and inexpensive fish. I loved the idea of piling coleslaw.
